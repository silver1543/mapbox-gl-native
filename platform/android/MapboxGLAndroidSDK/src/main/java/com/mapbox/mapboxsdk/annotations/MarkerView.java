 * The MGLAnnotationView class is responsible for representing point-based annotation markers as a view.
 * Annotation views represent an annotation object, which is an object that corresponds to the Annotation protocol.
 * When an annotationâ€™s coordinate point is visible on the map view, the map view adapter is asked
 * to provide a corresponding annotation view. If an annotation view is created with a reuse identifier,
 * the map view may recycle the view when it goes offscreen.
