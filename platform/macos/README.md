Put interactive, scalable world maps into your native Cocoa application with the Mapbox macOS SDK.

* Mapbox-curated [map styles](https://www.mapbox.com/maps/) and [OpenStreetMap-based](https://www.mapbox.com/vector-tiles/mapbox-streets-v7/) [vector tiles](https://www.mapbox.com/vector-tiles/) make it easy to get started.
* Customize every aspect of the mapâ€™s appearance in code or visually using [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/).
* High-performance OpenGL rendering and multitouch gestures keep your users happy.
* A well-designed, fully documented API helps you stay productive.
* Develop across [multiple platforms](../../README.md), including [iOS](../ios/README.md), using the same styles and similar APIs.

The Mapbox macOS SDK is compatible with macOS 10.10.0 and above for Cocoa applications developed in Objective-C, Swift, Interface Builder, or AppleScript. For hybrid applications, consider [Mapbox GL JS](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/).
